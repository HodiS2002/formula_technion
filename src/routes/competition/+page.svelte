            <p class="">
                When you ask an engineering student "What have you done
                throughout the 4 years of your studies," most will answer
                "Equations." This results in a scenario where even the most
                accomplished students felt clueless and inexperienced upon
                entering the competitive job market. In the beginning of the
                1980's the SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) devised a
                solution. Groups of Mechanical/Automotive Engineering students
                from all over the world will DESIGN, BUILD and RACE a formula
                style (open wheel) vehicle.

                With a history spanning over 35 years, the competition has
                expanded significantly. Currently, there are over 600 ranked
                teams globally, and competitions take place on every continent:
                9 in Europe, 4 in North America, as well as in Japan, China,
                India, Brazil, and even in Australia down under.
            </p>
            <p class="">
                The competition challenges the teams in building a powerful,
                stable, reliable, safe and cost effective open wheel 'Formula'
                style race-car. The students are required to justify and explain
                their design to judges from all over the Automotive and
                Aerospace industry.
